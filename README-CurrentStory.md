# Current Story Persistence Feature

This feature allows you to continue reading a story across different devices without having to explicitly save it to your saved stories list.

## How It Works

1. When you generate a new story, it is automatically saved to the MongoDB database with a unique device ID
2. When you open the application on a different device, it retrieves the most recent story associated with that device
3. This works seamlessly in the background without requiring any user action

## Implementation Details

- Each device has a unique random ID stored in localStorage
- Current stories are stored in a separate MongoDB collection from saved stories
- Only the most recent 5 stories per device are kept to optimize storage
- Translations are also synchronized across devices

## Troubleshooting

If you're not seeing your latest story when switching devices:

1. Make sure both devices are connected to the internet
2. Check that your MongoDB database is running
3. Try refreshing the page on the new device
4. If all else fails, you can always save stories explicitly to ensure they persist

## Privacy Considerations

- Device IDs are randomly generated and don't contain personal information
- No user authentication is required for this feature
- Stories are only tied to device IDs, not to any user identity

```

Instead of relying only on browser localStorage, the current story is now stored in your MongoDB database, making it accessible from any device.
